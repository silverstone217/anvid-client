# Anvid - Client

## Description

Anvid is an anonymous video chat application that allows users to connect and communicate via video in real-time.
This client-side application is built using Next.js and leverages Socket.IO for real-time communication with the backend server.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for video chatting.
- Real-time updates when users join or leave chat rooms.
- Responsive design to support various devices.
- Secure handling of media streams with WebRTC.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- **WebRTC**: Technology that enables peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/silverstone217/anvid-client.git
   cd anvid-client
   ```
2. Install the following dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project

   ```

### Notes

1. **Customization**: Replace `silverstone217` in the clone URLs with your actual GitHub username or organization name.
2. **Environment Variables**: If your backend requires specific environment variables, consider adding a section in the backend README detailing what those are and how to set them up.
3. **Further Documentation**: Depending on your audience, you may want to add sections on testing, deployment instructions, or specific API endpoints in the backend README.

These README files should provide clear guidance on how to set up and use your application while also detailing the technologies involved. If you need further adjustments or additional sections, feel free to ask!
